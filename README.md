# Unity JS Wallet Adapter

This repository contains a minimalistic library for interacting with Solana wallets implementing the [Wallet Standard](https://github.com/wallet-standard/wallet-standard). 

It is used internally in the [Solana.Unity-SDK](https://github.com/magicblock-labs/Solana.Unity-SDK), see the [installation](https://github.com/magicblock-labs/Solana.Unity-SDK/tree/main#-installation) instructions to use it in your project.
